        But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish,
        the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing
        Flask's boat and marring the bows.

<p>We have two containers, a shape-inside: circle property is applied on the nested container. Since the nested container's height is not resolvable, we shouldn't apply the circle shape-inside on the content. <br/>We should see the content inside a 300px wide green container, the text shouldn't form any circular shape.</p>
<p>Bug <a href="http://webkit.org/b/113255 ">113255</a>: The radius of a circle should be computed based on the shorter available dimensions</p>
